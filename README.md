# Overview

# This project is a simple To-Do List app build with JavaScript. The app allows the user to add tasks, mark them as complete, edit, delete, and change the view to list or card view. Each task will display a timestamp using Day.js and the user can assign a due date. A dark mode toggle is also included.

# I wanted to gain more experience with JavaScript fundamentals like arrays, functions, DOM manipulation, event handling, and external libraries.
